In this notebook, we aim to predict the sale price of bulldozers using machine learning techniques based on a real dataset from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition. The dataset comprises training, validation, and test sets, containing information such as sales IDs, machine IDs, sale prices, and sale dates. Our goal is to accurately forecast the future sale price of bulldozers by analyzing historical sale prices and relevant characteristics. The evaluation metric for this task is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the predicted and actual auction prices. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we seek to provide insights into pricing dynamics in the bulldozer market, benefiting both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.
